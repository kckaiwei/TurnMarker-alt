# Turn Marker
**Turn Marker** is a module for [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/ "Foundry VTT") that adds an image under a token who is currently active in the combat tracker. This is completely system agnostic, and fully customizable to fit right into your game.

### Settings
#### Image ratio
The image ratio is related to the size of the token. 1 will be the same size as the active token, 2 will be double the size, etc.
#### Animate Marker
If enabled, the marker will use a rotational animation as defined by "Animation Speed" and "Animation Degrees".
#### Animation Speed
Defines in milliseconds how often the animation should apply a rotation. The lower the number the faster the animation.
#### Animation Degrees
Defines in degrees how much the marker should rotate on each tick.
#### Marker Image
Select from a number of included images provided by the Foundry Community:
